    <p>Yummy sticky buns! What can be better than a hot sticky bun for breakfast or a late-night snack? Pop one into the microwave for a few seconds to make them taste fresh from the oven.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li>2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast</li>
        <li>½ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>5 ½ cups unbleached all-purpose flour, divided</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups buttermilk, room temperature</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>3/4 cup white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>⅔ cup chopped pecans</li>
        <li>⅓ cup raisins</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 2 1/2 cups flour, buttermilk, eggs, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup softened butter, baking powder, and salt to yeast mixture; stir until well combined. Stir in remaining 3 cups flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. Dough should remain soft and slightly sticky. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half, then roll each half into a 12x7-inch rectangle. Spread each rectangle with 1 tablespoon softened butter, then sprinkle with 1/4 cup white sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Roll up halves, beginning at a wide side; pinch seams to seal well. Cut each roll into 12 equal slices.</li>
        <li>Coat 2 (9-inch) round cake pans, each with 1/4 cup melted butter, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 of the pecans, and 1/2 of the raisins. Arrange 12 dough slices in each prepared pan, leaving a small space between slices. Cover and let rise until doubled, 30 to 60 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Invert the pans onto serving plates, lift up the pans to release sticky buns, and serve hot.</li>
